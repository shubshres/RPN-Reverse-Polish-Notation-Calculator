# RPN-Reverse-Polish-Notation-Calculator-
Created an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) Calculator Using Python
Used Python to create a simple calculator that accepts Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and displays the final answer (Intermediate steps or results need not be displayed).

It only accepts 4 operators “+”, “-“, “*”, “/”.

Input numbers will be single digits.

The input will be in postfix notation.

The input will be provided in a text file called input_RPN.txt. Your program should not ask the user for any input.

There will be one RPN expression in each line.

The code is able to read the file and print the result for each RPN in a new line. 

Example of RPN: 4 2 + and your output should be 6. This is a simple expression. More complex algebraic notations will be used to test your program like the one below. 

Example algebraic notation: ( 4 + 2 * 5 ) / ( 1 + 3 * 2 )

Translated into RPN: 4 2 5 * + 1 3 2 * + /

Code is able to read the input file from the same folder.
